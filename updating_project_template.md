Unfortunately updating the project template doesn't auto fill all proper information back into the menu.  
So some manual work is required.

1. If files are moved/renamed or added/removed make sure the project is up to date with these changes
2. Do not include .mex files in the project!
3. Don't forget to up the version if required
4. From the 'PROJECT' tab in Matlab, from the 'Share' dropdown menu select 'Simulink Template'
5. Change the Author to GOcontroll
6. Set the image to GOcontroll.png which is located in the project
7. It might show a warning about the .mex files which aren't included, check if this is the case, if so 'continue anyway'
